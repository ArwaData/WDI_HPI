## Domain Background
The World Development Indicators (WDI) is the World Bank's most comprehensive collection of cross-country development data.
The World Development Indicators is a collection of data on global development and poverty reduction that are relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable. The database comprises 1,400 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 nation groupings, with many of the indicators having data going all the way back more than 50 years.

The Happy Planet Index is a measure of sustainable wellbeing that ranks countries based on how effectively they use limited natural resources to produce long, happy lives.
We need it because multiple crises, such as persistent inequalities, accelerating climate breakdown, and rapid biodiversity loss, are interconnected and stem from the same root cause: our economies are structured, governed, and measured to promote short-term economic growth over long-term collective wellbeing. Governments frequently place faster economic growth above all other considerations. They lose sight of what really matters: people living long, happy, and sustainable lives all across the world.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze the data and answer some questions that are relative to  global development and poverty reduction for each dataset, and we will try to understand the problems that some countries are having then we will try to find the causation of it. 
in addition, we will use what I've learned in Machine learning to build a model that predict the happiness and well-being rate for some countries.
